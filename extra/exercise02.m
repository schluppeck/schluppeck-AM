%% What's in your current work space?

whos

%% If there are any variables, 

%% Create a variable 
%  a that stores the number 10

% -- Enter your code here -- %



%% Find out more about a
%  using whos or the openvar command

% -- Enter your code here -- %


%% Make a vector
%  using the bracket notation

% how to make a column vector containing 1 2 3

% -- Enter your code here -- %


% this redefines b as a row vector
b = [1 2 3]

%  or the colon notation

b = 1:10

% or using the extended version of the colon notation
% to make all the ODD numbers from 1 to 11

b = 1:2:11

%% Working with vectors
%  you are allowed to add a single number to a vector
%  or to add to vectors that are the same size

%% add 15 to b

% -- Enter your code here -- %

c = 2:2:12

%% add b and c

% -- Enter your code here -- %


%% but the following will give you an error:

c + [1 2]

% Why is this -- and does it make sense?

%% Joining vectors
%  you can use the bracket notation to join vectors
%  e.g. [a b]  as long as the sizes make sense!
